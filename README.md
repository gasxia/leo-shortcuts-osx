## A [Leo](http://leoeditor.com/) settings file for OSX ##


This is a settings / preferences file for leo to make shortcuts more mac like.

###Important###

The QT Runtime changes the CTRL definition to CMD.

To read a key definition you'll have to translate:

+ CTRL  -  Mac CMD key

+ ALT  -  Mac ALT key

+ META  -  Mac CTRL key

+ SHIFT  -  Mac SHIFT key



The main purpose is to get mac typical shortcuts like

+ ALT-Left/Right for word movement

+ SHIFT-ALT-Left/Right extending the selection by words

+ CMD-Left/Right/Up/Down begin/end of line/body-node

It's far from perfect and I still haven't found a way to make forward-word stopping at the end of a word and not on the next line. But it makes Leo usable for longtime mac users.
